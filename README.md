This repository houses the commands used to generate the data found in "Effect of gut microbiota and PNPLA3 rs738409 variant on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese youth". The three primary documents are:

1. Qiime2 Script - This details the script constructed to import and process the demultiplexed FASTQ files. The outputs from this script are used in the R markdown document including "taxonomy.qza", "table.qza", and "rooted-tree.qza". 

2. Rmarkdown_alpha_diversity_and_heatmap.md - This shows the commands used for import into phyloseq, calculation of Shannon Index alpha diversity values, and all steps and outputs from the heatmap generation steps. 

3. Supplemental Figure 1 - Heatmap figure referenced in paper and showing the overall microbial community structure for each sample used in this study.

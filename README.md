# Paper-Commands

This repository houses the commands used to generate the data found in *PAPER CITATION*. The two primary documents are:

1. Qiime2 Script - This details the script constructed to import and process the demultiplexed FASTQ files. The outputs from this script are used in the R markdown document including "taxonomy.qza", "table.qza", and "rooted-tree.qza". 

2. Rmarkdown_alpha_diversity_heatmap.md - This shows the commands used for import into phyloseq, calculation of Shannon Index alpha diversity values, and all steps and outputs from the heatmap generation steps.
